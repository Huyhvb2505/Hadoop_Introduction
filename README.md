### Component Architecture

#### Hadoop Cluster Components
- **Namenode**: Manages filesystem metadata and namespace
- **Datanode 1 & 2**: Store actual data blocks with replication
- **Python Client**: Interactive environment for HDFS operations

#### Key Services
- **HDFS Web UI**: http://localhost:9870 (Namenode)
- **Datanode UI**: http://localhost:9864 (Primary Datanode)
- **HDFS API**: Port 8020 for programmatic access

## 🔧 Prerequisites

### Required Software
- Docker (>= 20.10)
- Docker Compose (>= 2.0)
- 4GB+ available RAM
- 10GB+ available disk space

### Optional Tools
- Python 3.9+ (for local development)
- Web browser (for UI access)
- Text editor/IDE

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup Environment
```bash
# Clone or navigate to the demo directory
cd "D9 - Hadoop Introduction"

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x setup.sh cleanup.sh run_exercise.sh

# Start the Hadoop cluster
./setup.sh
```

### 2. Verify Installation
```bash
# Check cluster status
docker-compose ps

# Access HDFS Web UI
open http://localhost:9870

# Enter Python client
docker exec -it hadoop-python-client bash
```

### 3. Run Demo
```bash
# Run the complete demonstration
./run_exercise.sh demo

# Or run individual exercises
./run_exercise.sh 1  # Basic operations
./run_exercise.sh 2  # Data processing
./run_exercise.sh 3  # Text analysis
./run_exercise.sh 4  # Advanced pipeline
```

### 4. Cleanup
```bash
# Stop the cluster
./cleanup.sh

# Remove all data (optional)
docker-compose down -v
```
